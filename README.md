# Rightclick-Wiki
Adds an option to right-click menus to search for the relevant osrs wiki page.

Currently supports wiki lookups for:
- NPCs (General version - e.g. if you try on a Banker(Zanaris), you'll just get Banker)
- Objects (General version - e.g. if you try on a Bank booth, you'll just get Bank booth)
- Items (On the ground or on other surfaces in the world)

Planned:
- Specific-version NPCs
- Specific-version Objects
- Items in inventory
- Config
